B. Consumer electronics connected to cloud services
C. Networked sensors, controllers, and software systems enabling monitoring and automation
D. A technology used only for data storage

---

### **3. True or False**

In industrial IoT systems, **reliability and safety** are generally more important than convenience and user experience.

---

### **4. Short Answer**

What is the role of a **sensor** in an automation or IoT system?

---

### **5. Short Answer**

What is the role of an **actuator** in an automation or IoT system?

---

### **6. Multiple Choice**

Which of the following best represents the **main components of a typical IoT system architecture**?

A. Input → Output → Memory → CPU
B. Sensors → Cloud → Mobile App
C. Devices → Network → Processing → Application
D. PLC → HMI → SCADA → Cloud

---

### **7. True or False**

IoT technologies are designed to completely replace PLCs in industrial control systems.

---

### **8. Short Answer**

Give **one reason** why PLCs are still widely used in automation systems even when IoT technologies are introduced.

---

### **9. Short Answer**

Why are **embedded microcontrollers (MCUs)** often used alongside PLCs in modern IoT-based automation systems?

---

### **10. Scenario-Based Question**

A factory has a PLC-controlled motor system that operates correctly but provides no historical data or remote visibility.

Explain **one way** IoT could be added to this system **without replacing the PLC**, and describe the benefit.

---

## **Answers**

### **1.**

IoT is introduced to extend traditional automation systems with connectivity, enabling remote monitoring, centralized data collection, diagnostics, analytics, and data-driven optimization while keeping existing control logic intact.

---

### **2.**

**C.** Networked sensors, controllers, and software systems enabling monitoring and automation

---

### **3.**

**True**

Industrial IoT prioritizes reliability, determinism, and safety over convenience.

---

### **4.**

A sensor measures a physical quantity (such as temperature, pressure, or position) and converts it into a signal or data that can be processed by a controller.

---

### **5.**

An actuator receives control commands and performs physical actions, such as turning a motor, opening a valve, or switching a relay.

---

### **6.**

**C.** Devices → Network → Processing → Application

---

### **7.**

**False**

IoT technologies complement PLCs by adding connectivity and data access; they do not replace PLC-based control.

---

### **8.**

PLCs are still used because they provide deterministic real-time control, high reliability, and certified safety features required in industrial environments.

---

### **9.**

MCUs are used to handle tasks such as high-speed data acquisition, signal processing, protocol translation, and IoT communication, allowing PLCs to focus on real-time control and safety logic.

---

### **10.**

Example answer:
An embedded MCU or IoT gateway can be added to read PLC data (such as motor status, runtime, or alarms) and send it to a monitoring system. This enables remote monitoring, historical data logging, and predictive maintenance without changing the PLC control logic.
