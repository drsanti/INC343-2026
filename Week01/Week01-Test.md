---

## **Questions**

1. What is a **computer-based control and monitoring system**?

2. State **one main difference** between a control system and a monitoring system.

3. Which component directly **measures a physical quantity**?
   A. Actuator
   B. Controller
   C. Sensor
   D. Monitoring software

4. True or False:
   A monitoring system actively changes the behavior of a physical process.

5. Give **one example** of an actuator used in industrial automation.

6. Which statement best describes a **closed-loop control system**?
   A. A system without sensors
   B. A system that uses feedback to adjust its output
   C. A system used only for monitoring
   D. A system that operates manually

7. What is the **primary function of a controller** in an automation system?

8. At which level of the **automation pyramid** are sensors and actuators typically located?
   A. Enterprise level
   B. Supervisory level
   C. Control level
   D. Field level

9. True or False:
   Web-based monitoring systems allow remote access through a web browser.

10. Why is **real-time response** important in control systems?

---

## **Answers**

1. A system that uses computers and software to monitor and/or control physical processes by processing sensor data and controlling actuators.

2. A control system actively regulates a process, while a monitoring system only observes and reports system data.

3. **C. Sensor**

4. **False**

5. Examples include: electric motor, solenoid valve, pneumatic actuator.

6. **B. A system that uses feedback to adjust its output**

7. To process sensor data and generate control commands to achieve the desired system behavior.

8. **D. Field level**

9. **True**

10. Because control systems must respond quickly to changes in the physical process to maintain stability, performance, and safety.
