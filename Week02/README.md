# **Week 2: Development Environment Setup and Toolchain**

> Setting up your development environment with Visual Studio Code, Node.js, and Docker Desktop for control and monitoring system development.

---

## 📖 **Week 2 Overview**

This week focuses on **setting up your development environment** for building control and monitoring systems. You will install and configure essential software tools including Visual Studio Code (IDE), Node.js (runtime environment), and Docker Desktop (containerization platform). Understanding these tools is critical for developing reliable automation software.
