**Topic: Development Environment and Toolchain for Control and Monitoring Systems**

---

## **Questions**

1. Why is a **standardized development environment** important in automation engineering?

2. Which command would you use to check the Node.js version in the command line?
   A. `node --version`
   B. `npm --version`
   C. `node version`
   D. `npm check`

3. What is **Node.js** primarily designed for?

4. True or False:
   TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that helps detect errors at compile-time.

5. Give **one advantage** of using TypeScript in automation systems.

6. What does **Docker** provide for applications?
   A. Faster execution speed
   B. Isolated, consistent runtime environments
   C. Automatic code compilation
   D. Built-in debugging tools

7. Which of the following is a key feature of Visual Studio Code that is useful for automation engineering?
   A. Integrated debugging tools
   B. Built-in sensors
   C. Real-time control algorithms
   D. Industrial communication protocols

8. True or False:
   Node.js is well-suited for control and monitoring systems due to its non-blocking I/O model.

9. What is **npm** and what does it stand for?

10. Give **one reason** why Docker containerization is useful in automation engineering applications.

## **Answers**

1. A standardized development environment ensures consistent behavior across different machines, reproducibility of system builds, easier debugging and maintenance, and reliable deployment to industrial or cloud environments. It prevents communication failures, timing errors, and inconsistent control behavior.

2. **A. `node --version`**

3. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment designed for building networked and event-driven applications, particularly suited for systems requiring efficient handling of concurrent connections and non-blocking I/O operations.

4. **True**

5. Advantages include: type safety prevents incorrect data types that could cause unsafe control behavior; compile-time error detection catches errors before runtime; improved code readability and maintainability for large systems; ability to define clear interfaces for sensors, actuators, and messages.

6. **B. Isolated, consistent runtime environments**

7. **A. Integrated debugging tools**

8. **True**

9. npm stands for **Node Package Manager**. It is a package manager that comes with Node.js and is used to install, manage, and share JavaScript/TypeScript packages and dependencies for projects.

10. Reasons include: packaging control applications with all dependencies; ensuring consistent behavior across development and deployment environments; simplifying system installation and updates; supporting scalable deployment of monitoring services; useful for web-based monitoring systems, data processing services, and distributed control architectures.
