# **Week 3: Programming Foundations and Control System Basics**

> Learning TypeScript programming fundamentals and core control system concepts to build the foundation for Quiz 1.

---

## 📖 **Week 3 Overview**

This week introduces **TypeScript programming fundamentals** and **core control system concepts**. You will learn how to write TypeScript code to represent control system components (sensors, actuators, controllers) and implement basic control logic. This week is crucial preparation for **Quiz 1**, which covers both theoretical knowledge and practical programming skills.
